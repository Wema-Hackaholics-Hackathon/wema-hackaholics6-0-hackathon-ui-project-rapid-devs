# Shadow IT Control Platform - Enterprise Extension

## Current Capabilities
- ✅ Real-time traffic monitoring
- ✅ Service blocking with custom pages
- ✅ Usage analytics and reporting
- ✅ Dashboard with charts and statistics

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. App Categorization System
```python
APP_CATEGORIES = {
    "approved": ["slack.com", "office365.com", "github.com"],
    "pending_review": ["notion.so", "figma.com"],
    "blocked": ["dropbox.com", "wetransfer.com"],
    "high_risk": ["mega.nz", "anonymousfiles.io"]
}
```

### 2. Risk Scoring
- Automatically assess risk based on:
  - Data sensitivity capabilities
  - Authentication methods
  - Compliance certifications
  - User base size

### 3. Fast-Track Approval Process
- Users request access through blocked page
- Low-risk apps get auto-approved
- Dashboard shows pending requests
- IT can approve/deny with one click

### 4. Smart Notifications
- Alert when new shadow IT detected
- Weekly reports of discovered services
- Compliance violation warnings
- Usage trend analysis

### 5. Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Monitor file uploads to unapproved services
- Block sensitive data patterns
- Log attempted data exfiltration

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Discovery (Current)
- ✅ Monitor all network traffic
- ✅ Identify cloud services
- ✅ Track usage patterns

### Phase 2: Control
- Categorize discovered services
- Implement risk-based blocking
- Create approval workflow

### Phase 3: Intelligence
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Predictive risk analysis
- Automated policy recommendations

## Business Benefits
1. **Visibility**: 100% discovery of shadow IT
2. **Security**: Prevent data breaches
3. **Compliance**: Ensure regulatory adherence
4. **Agility**: Fast approval for safe tools
5. **Cost**: Identify duplicate/unused services
